# -User-Response-Prediction-

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project! ðŸš€

I recently completed a project titled "User Response Prediction System using Machine Learning Techniques." This project focused on predicting whether users would click on ads, a key metric in digital marketing.

ðŸ’¡ Highlights:

Utilized machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to analyze user behavior based on factors such as age, internet usage, and time spent on websites.
Achieved a 96% accuracy with the Random Forest model, significantly improving ad targeting strategies.
Key insights showed that users with lower internet usage and shorter site visits were more likely to click on ads, providing valuable information for advertisers.
This project not only enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation but also gave me hands-on experience with real-world applications in digital marketing.

Looking forward to applying these skills in future projects and further exploring how machine learning can transform advertising! ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š
